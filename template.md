# Weather Dashboard

The goal of this project is to provide a simple dashboard where the user can input a city name and see the current weather condition for that location, as well as a brief five day forecast.  Once a city is searched it is saved into a list where it can be clicked to quickly change the displayed location to the city clicked.
